So, What do you think? According to me, it depends on an individual. If a person decides to enter programming with a Never Give Up attitude then sure he can do it but if someone has already made his mind that it is not for me, then nothing can change it. It is a person's attitude that decides if he is going to be successful in the field chosen by him or not.

## Story Time..


### Why is the Lion considered King of Jungle?


Is it the biggest? No, Elephants are bigger. Is it the smartest? No, Hyenas are smarter than Lions. So, it might be the most intelligent. The answer is no again. Chimpanzees are more intelligent. It is not the tallest as well, Giraffe is taller.

But but but...When an elephant sees a lion, he runs, even though he's bigger, stronger, smarter, and more powerful than a Lion. So, why is it? The elephant is a victim of how he thinks!! When the lion sees an elephant, he runs towards the elephant because he believes that he can hop on an elephant and eat it.

### What's wrong here?

Any guesses? Yes, you guessed it right. The lion is the king of the Jungle because he thinks he is. He has a different attitude and his actions reflect the way he thinks. This attitude makes all the animal kingdom respect the lion more than any other animal.

Attitude is the result of our beliefs. Our actions reflect what we believe. We become what we believe. We limit ourselves by what we believe. So, the need of the hour is to start believing in yourself and stop putting yourself down, and have confidence in your belief.


### No one can live beyond the limits of their beliefs.


So, stop thinking "I can't do this." Stop making excuses. If someone says you can't do it, let them say and you do what you believe. Change your belief system. Your ability to become a programmer is trapped by you and your belief.

Hope this was the motivation you needed to start your programming journey. Thanks for reading and let's start our journey together. Have an amazing day..âœŒ
